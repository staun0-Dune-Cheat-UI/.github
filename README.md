## 🧠 What Is the Dune Cheat UI?

The Dune Cheat UI is a **real-time overlay menu** that appears directly in-game, giving you full control over ESP, aimbot, survival mods, spice farming tools, movement hacks, and more. Think of it as your **personal control panel for survival supremacy**.

Use it in PvE, PvP, base raids, and faction wars—this cheat UI adjusts in real-time with hotkeys and drop-downs, no alt-tabbing required.

## ⚠️ Safety Tips

While the cheat UI is injected using **stealth methods**, it’s always smart to play it low-key:

* Limit max settings in public zones
* Use soft aim + low FOV for less suspicious PvP
* Avoid teleport spam near factions
* Rotate accounts if you’re going full rage mode

The tools are clean. How you use them? That’s on you 😎
